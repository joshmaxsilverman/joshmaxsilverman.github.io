>**Question**: In a more advanced course, you’ve been asked to draw a 3D sketch of the function ${z = \vert x\rvert + \lvert y\rvert}.$ As you’re about to do this, you are struck by another bout of dizziness, and your resulting graph is randomly rotated in $3\text{D}$ space.

>More specifically, your graph has the correct origin. But the true $z$-axis is equally likely to point from the origin to any point on the surface of the unit sphere. (Meanwhile, the $x$-axis is equally likely to point in any direction perpendicular to the $z$-axis. From there, the $y$-axis is uniquely determined.)

>What is the probability that the resulting graph you produce is in fact a function (i.e., $z$ is a function of $x$ and $y$)?
