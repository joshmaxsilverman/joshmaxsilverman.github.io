>**Question**: You're playing a game of three on three basketball in a weird league. The rule on foul shots on a three pointer is that all three players from the team get to take turns shooting three foul shots. However, to get the second foul shot the team must make the first, and to get the second foul shot the team must make the second. As soon as a player misses, the foul shooting is over. If the players on your team have foul shot percentages $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ (no two equal), then what is the maximum number of shooting orders that would produce the same expected number of points?
