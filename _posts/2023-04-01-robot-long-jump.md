>**Question**: Great news! The variety of robotic competition continues to grow at breakneck pace! Most recently, head-to-head long jump contests have been all the rage.
>
>These contests consist of rounds in which each robot has a single attempt to score. In an attempt, a robot speeds down the running track (modeled as the numberline) from $0,$ the starting line, to $1,$ the takeoff point. A robot moves along this track by drawing a real number uniformly from $\left[0,1\right]$ and adding it to the robot’s current position. After each of these advances, the robot must decide whether to jump or wait. If a robot crosses the takeoff point (at $1$) before jumping its attempt receives a score of $0.$ If the robot jumps before crossing $1,$ it draws one final real number from $\left[0,1\right]$ and adds it to its current position, and this final sum is the score of the attempt.
>
>In a head-to-head contest, the two robots each have a single attempt without knowing the other’s result. In the case that they tie (typically because they both scored $0$), that round is discarded and a new round begins. As soon as one robot scores higher than the other on the same round, that robot is declared the winner!
>
>Assume both robots are programmed to optimize their probability of winning and are aware of each other’s strategies. You are just sitting down to watch a match’s very first attempt (of the first round, which may or may not end up being discarded). What is the probability that this attempt scores $0$? Give this probability as a decimal rounded to $9$ digits past the decimal point.
