>**Question**: For a fixed $p,$ independently label the nodes of an infinite complete binary tree $0$ with probability $p,$ and $1$ otherwise. For what $p$ is there exactly a $1/2$ probability that there exists an infinite path down the tree that sums to at most $1$ (that is, all nodes visited, with the possible exception of one, will be labeled $0$)?

## Solution

To access a path with at most one label placed, it either must be the case that:
- the current node is labelless and goes on to a path with at most one label placed, or
- the current node is labelled and goes on to a path with no labels placed.

Calling the probability of a zero-label path $P_\text{zero},$ and the probability of a path with at most one label $P_\text{either},$ we can capture this with the following equation:

$$ 
  \begin{align}
    P_\text{either} &= P(\text{at least one 0}) + P(\text{at least one 1}) \\
                    &= 2p P_\text{either} + 2(1-p)P_\text{zero} - p P^2_\text{either} - (1-p) P^2_\text{zero}) 
  \end{align}
$$

We can find the probability of a zero-label path with the same kind of analysis:

$$ P_\text{zero} = 2p P_\text{zero} - p P^2_\text{zero}. $$

This is solved by

$$ P_\text{zero} = 
  \begin{cases} 
    0 & p < \frac12 \\ 
    \dfrac{2p-1}{p} & p \geq \frac12 
  \end{cases} 
$$

So, $P_\text{zero}$ is zero until $p=\frac12$ after which it shoots up, approaching $1$ as $p$ approaches $1.$ Plugging this solution into the first equation, we can solve it for $P_\text{either}$:


$$ P_\text{either} = \dfrac{2 p+\sqrt{\dfrac{4 (p-1)^3}{p}+1}-1}{2 p}. $$

Plugging in $P_\text{either}=\frac12,$ we can solve for the value $p_\frac12$:

$$ 
  \begin{align}
    p_{1/2} &= \dfrac{1}{9} \left(10-\dfrac{4\ 2^{2/3}}{\sqrt[3]{9 \sqrt{57}-67}}+\sqrt[3]{2 \left(9 \sqrt{57}-67\right)}\right) \\ 
            &\approx 0.5306035754 
  \end{align} 
$$

Plotting $P_\text{either}$ alongside $P_\text{zero},$ we see similar thresholding behavior with a much steeper rise after $p=\frac12$:
