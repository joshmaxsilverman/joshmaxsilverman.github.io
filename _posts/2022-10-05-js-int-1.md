This problem came across my feed purporting to be a Jane Street interview problem. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but it was a lot of fun. the problem has depth --- the main question is short and sweet, but uncovering the distribution of $\ell$ has two nice wrinkles.
 
>**Question**: A random line segment of length $\ell$ is chosen on a plane marked with an infinite checkerboard grid (i.e., a unit side length square grid). What length $\ell$ maximizes the probability that the segment crosses exactly one line on the checkerboard grid, and what is this maximal probability?

## Solution

the intuition is that a very short stick (compared to the unit cell) is unlikely to cross **any** line on the checkerboard, because it's unlikely to land within striking distance of a line. likewise, a stick that's long compared to the unit cell will be likely to cross **more** than one line on the board. somewhere in the middle, there's a balance.

when the stick lands, it has some orientation $\theta$ and position. we'll take the location to be its left-most point $P.$ the problem is symmetric with respect to positive and negative angles, so we'll just consider angles from $0$ to $\pi/4.$

## Small sticks

to start, let's think about sticks with lengths between $0$ and $1.$ these are simple because the only way for them to have two crossings is to make one vertical crossing and one horizontal crossing. they aren't long enough to, e.g. make two horizontal crossings.

we can draw a box around the stick which will have side lengths $\ell\cos\theta$ on the bottom, and $\ell\sin\theta$ on the top. since the height of the box is $\ell\sin\theta,$ it will only cross the upper edge of the cell if $P$ is within $\ell\sin\theta$ of the top. so, the probability that it does not intersect the top is $(1 - \ell\sin\theta).$ 

by the same logic, the probability that the bar does cross horizontally is $\ell\cos\theta.s 

so, the chance that the bar intersects only one edge is 

$$
\begin{align}
  P(\text{one crossing}) &= 2P(\text{one horizontal crossing})\times P(\text{no vertical crossing}) \\
  &= 2\ell\cos\theta\times\left(1-\ell\sin\theta\right).
\end{align}
$$

averaging over all possible angles, the probability of a single intersection is then

$$
\begin{align}
  P(\text{one crossing}) &=\frac{4}{\pi} \int\limits_0^{\pi/4} \ell\cos\theta(1-\ell\sin\theta)\text{d}\theta \\
  &= \frac{4}{\pi} \int\limits_0^{\pi/4} \left(\ell\cos\theta - \ell^2\cos\theta\sin\theta\right) \text{d}\theta \\
  &= \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\ell - \frac12\ell^2\right),
\end{align}
$$

a nice quadratic that rises until it flattens out at the upper range of our figuring above, $\ell = 1.$ the result is nice and simple, we can increase the chance of one crossing until the stick is as long as the unit cell and, past that, higher order crossings start to dominate. 

so, the optimum stick length is just $\ell=1,$ and the maximum probability for one crossing is $\frac{4}{\pi}(1 - \frac12) = 2/\pi\approx 0.6366$

plotting the distribution $P(\ell) = \frac{2}{\pi}\left(1 - \frac12\ell^2\right),$ we see wonderful agreement inside the bounds of our analysis.

beyond the bounds however, the agreement is not good!

this is no surprise, since we've ignored multiple horizontal crossings. 

## Big sticks

when $\ell\cos\theta > 1,$ the stick will have at least one horizontal crossing, and the worry becomes whether it there will be a second. the only way for the stick to make two horizontal crossings is if $P$ starts more than $\left(2 - \ell\cos\theta\right)$ away from the edge of the unit cell. 

now we have

$$
  P(\ell) =
\begin{cases}
 \ell\cos\theta & 0\leq\ell\cos\theta\lt 1 \\
 2 - \ell\cos\theta & 1 \leq \ell\cos\theta
\end{cases}     
$$

and

$$
\begin{align}
  P(\text{one crossing}) &= \frac{4}{\pi}\left[\int\limits_0^{\cos^{-1}\ell^{-1}}  \left(2 - \ell\cos\theta\right) \left(1 - \ell\sin\theta\right)\ \text{d}\theta + \int\limits_{\cos^{-1}\ell^{-1}}^{\pi/4}  \ell\cos\theta\left(1 - \ell\sin\theta\right)\ \text{d}\theta\right] \\
  &= ()
\end{align}
$$

plotting this alongside the simulation, we see that we've captured even more of the behavior. but we are still reminded of our failure. for long sticks, we are severely underestimating the contribution of higher order crossings.

going back to our drawings, we can see what's going on.

an interesting puzzle is that our distribution crashes to zero well before $\ell = \sqrt{5},$ the greatest possible length where it is physically possible to make only one crossing. while it's still physically possible, the tight restriction on orientations and location crash the probability to zero.
